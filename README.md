# ASCII Studio

A clean little tool that turns images, videos, text, and your webcam into ASCII art. Drop a file, flip on the camera, tweak some sliders, boom. ASCII.

## What it does
- Converts images, videos, text, and live camera feed
- Custom character sets  
- Contrast, brightness, saturation, sepia  
- Color or monochrome  
- Zoom controls  
- Exports to TXT, HTML, PNG, or just copy the text

## How to use
1. Open the HTML file in your browser.  
2. Upload an image, load a video, or turn on the cam.  
3. Adjust the settings until it looks good.  
4. Export if you want to save it.

## Tech behind it
- HTML + TailwindCSS  
- JavaScript  
- Web Worker for fast ASCII generation  
- Canvas for frame processing

Simple tool. Works (mostly) clean. Enjoy. :)
